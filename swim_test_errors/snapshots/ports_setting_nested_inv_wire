error: Cannot set the value of i.nested.back because it is an input with type inv &uint<8>
    ┌─ ports.py:14
    │
 14 │ s.i.nested.back = 0
    │ ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ i.nested.back cannot be set

  Help: The field has type inv &uint<8>
  Help: Since this is an input, only signals with non-inv type can be set
