# Spade

A work in progress HDL that doesn't make you want to pull your hair out. Taking
inspiration from rust and clash, the goal is to make a safer more expressive
language than Verilog and VHDL but without sacrificing the ability for low
level control of the hardware.

To learn more about the Spade language, see the website at
[https://spade-lang.org](https://spade-lang.org) or the language documentation
at [https://docs.spade-lang.org](https://docs.spade-lang.org)

## Getting started

To get started with Spade, see
[https://docs.spade-lang.org/introduction.html](https://docs.spade-lang.org/introduction.html).
You should start by [installing Spade](https://docs.spade-lang.org/installation.html) and then [setting up your editor](https://docs.spade-lang.org/editor-setup.html).

## Development and Community

If you are interested in using or contributing to Spade, feel free to join our
[discord group](https://discord.gg/YtXbeamxEX).

If you want to understand the compiler, the [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) document is a good place to start. It gives
a high level overview of the inner workings of the compiler.

Spade is currently being developed as an Open Source project at the Department
of Electrical Engineering at Link√∂ping university.
